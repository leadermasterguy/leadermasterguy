 # Introduction👋
Hello, I'm leadermasterguy, or Nick T. This Github account primarily exists to host my school projects, although it was originally created for personal use(*hence the corny username*). I am currently pursuing an associates degree in computer programming.
 
 # Coding Experience💻
 I am rather green when it comes to programming, but most of what I have learned has been in the form of Java. I have a small amount of experience reading and writing Python and Lua(moreso Python).
 In the near future, I am going to be learning the basics of both Javascript and Html.

 # Contact Me☎️
 Your best bet in contacting me would be discord, although my usernames on most other platforms are the same(leadermasterguy).
 * Discord: leadermasterguy#0926

### Credits
 The images at the top of the page(and my profile pic) come from a website called [craiyon.com](https://www.craiyon.com/), which is able to use an AI to generate images based on a users inputs. I quite enjoy the images that this can produce.
